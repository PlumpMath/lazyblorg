** Basic Text Formatting
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2014-01-30 Thu 16:33]
:END:

This is *bold* and *bold case*. And this is ~teletype style~.

Examples with line-breaks in between: *This is a bold sentence which
has a line break*.

*** not yet implemented                                      :noexport:

and /italic/ and _underlined_ and +strikethrough+ 

: This is a verbose statement.
: With a second line.
:    ... and a third one http://heise.de *not bold* foobar

** URLs

Without brackets: http://heise.de

With brackets and no description: [[http://heise.de]]

With brackets and a description: [[http://heise.de][heise]]

URLs with line breaks within: this is a very tough example of [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][an url
like this which is very long]].

Multiple URLs in one line: http://heise.de [[http://heise.de]] [[http://heise.de][heise]]

:PROPERTIES:
