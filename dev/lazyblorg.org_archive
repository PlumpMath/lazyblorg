- INI file format probably a better solution

- Possible methods to store configuration/settings of a weblog system
  that scans Org-mode files to generate HTML:
  - in drawers: see below
  - in tables: see below
  - in tags: see below
  - other possibilities?

- why not using elisp-methods like "setq" or "defvar" or "defcustom"?
  - this weblog will be implemented in Python
  - Sorry, I do not have any elisp knowledge and it seems to be the
    case that this is not going to change within the next months.
  - In Python I have to parse a basic sub-set of Org-mode format
    anyhow. An additional parser would be more work to do.
  - Why not using Org-mode for end-user configuration as well?
    - It's more user-friendly for non elisp users like me.

- <2013-01-02 Wed 17:21> INI-file format seems to be the better solution

**** Configuring Paths (in Drawers)
:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %PATH
:CREATED:  [2013-01-07 Mon 18:40]
:END:

- advantages
  - usage of column view
  - easy to add comments for each setting
- disadvantages
  - Properties have to be the same
    - not that flexible in naming Properties

- possible name for property "VALUE" which makes it more general.

***** Image-Path
:PROPERTIES:
:PATH: ~/images
:CREATED:  [2013-01-07 Mon 18:40]
:END:

In this folder, the Web log image files are placed after being
processed (resizing, ...).

***** HTML-Path
:PROPERTIES:
:PATH: ~/blog/html
:CREATED:  [2013-01-07 Mon 18:40]

**** Configuring Paths (in Tables)
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2013-01-07 Mon 18:40]
:END:

| *Variable*      | *Value*       | *Comments*                                          |
|-----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Image Path      | ~/images      | The path where the images should be placed in.      |
| HTML Path       | ~/blog/html   | Destination path for the HTML file folder structure |
| Another Setting | another value | This has to be very short.                          |

- advantages
  - easy to write and maintain
  - quick overview
- disadvantages
  - hard to add (long) comments for each setting

**** Configuring Paths (with Tags)
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2013-01-07 Mon 18:40]
:END:

- advantages
  - same settings can be shared through multiple tags on same value
  - easy to add comments for each setting
- disadvantages
  - seems strange at first glance; not sure if this really makes any
    sense at all
  - multiple word preference name has to be written in CamelCase or
    separated with dashes
