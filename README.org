* lazyblorg -- blogging with Org-mode for very lazy people

This is a web log (blog) environment for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][GNU Emacs]] with [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]]. 

For a list of similar/alternative projects, please visit
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html

See [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/49747/][my original post to the Org-mode ML]] for how this idea started.

- *target group*: users of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] who want to do blogging very easily
- *skills necessary*
  - modifying configuration settings, e.g., in script files
  - (optional) creating scheduled tasks (crond, ...)

** Why lazyblorg?

*Minimum effort* for blogging.

«A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing
left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.» ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%25C3%25A9ry][Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry]])

** Example

1. write a blog entry *anywhere* in your Org-mode files
2. add an unique ID in the PROPERTIES drawer
   - You might want to use a package that automatically generates
     unique IDs to your headings.
   - You might want to take a look [[article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/16199][at this solution using file or
     directory variables]].
3. tag your entry with :blog:
4. set the state of your entry to DONE

That's it. lazyblorg does the rest.

** Advantages

- *Minimum effort* to write a blog post.
- You do not need to maintain a specific Org-mode file that contains
  you blog posts only.
  - [[http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/07/BNotes][*Create* blog posts]] *anywhere* in between your notes, todos,
    contacts, ...
- You don't need to write HTML code by yourself.
- *(Static) HTML* offers best performance at a minimum of server load.
- No in-between format or tool.
  - Direct conversion from Org-mode to HTML/CSS.
- *Modern* HTML5/CSS3 standard.
- Decide by yourself how and where you are hosting your blog files
  and log files.

** Disadvantages

- lazyblorg is implemented in Python:
  - Its Org-mode parser supports only a sub-set of Org-mode syntax
    and features.
- No old HTML4.01 transitional stuff or similar:
  - Results might not be compatible with browsers such as Internet
    Explorer or mobile devices.

** Features

lazyblorg will support a basic set of syntax of Org-mode. It will
also support RSS feed(s), tags, (external) image files, tables,
updates, and more.

* Install

Currently, lazyblorg is in alpha status. It's not ready yet - Sorry!
